# Hackathon USP 2019 (Phase 1)
Repo dedicated to what has been development during Hackathon USP 2019 (Phase 1). 

A solution for the manual maintenance of USP's assets, which is currently done mannualy using print list, visually checking item by item. We have developed an app to do all this work. We suggest placing an RFID tag on all assets, thus making it possible to track inventory traffic in a department. All steps of development are in this repo: from the hardware to the cloud.

Our project has placed 2º on Hackathon USP 2019.
